# Consumption Data Forecast for HPC Systems

This project was developed as part of the Software Project: Distributed Systems course at Freie Universität Berlin. Our goal was to forecast two key variables energy price and CO₂ emissions for a HPC cluster at the *Physikalische Bundesanstalt Berlin* using different machine learning models. For more details about the methodology, implementation, and results, feel free to read the report file swp_t5_report.pdf!
